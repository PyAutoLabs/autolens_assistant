# skills/

Procedural how-to-do-X skills for the PyAuto\* lensing stack. Each skill is a single
Markdown file with YAML frontmatter; the body teaches an agent (and through them, the
user) how to write Python that accomplishes one lensing task.

Skills are also exposed at `.claude/skills/` (Claude Code) and `~/.codex/skills/` (when
configured) via symlinks; the canonical files live here.

## Conventions

- File names use the `al_<task>` convention for lensing-API skills, e.g. `al_run_search.md`.
- Project-workflow skills (repo-level operations, template manipulation) use a plain
  kebab-case name, e.g. `init-slam.md`, `start-new-project.md`.
- Meta-skills (writing guide, bootstrap protocol) start with `_`.
- Every lensing-API skill is **python-first**: the deliverable is a runnable `.py` script
  + the understanding to evolve it. Project-workflow skills may instead drive `rsync`,
  `cp`, or other repo-level operations.
- Source citations use the project-name + repo-relative-path form,
  e.g. `PyAutoFit:autofit/non_linear/search/nest/nautilus.py`, resolved via
  [`../sources.yaml`](../sources.yaml).
- Wiki references use workspace-relative paths,
  e.g. `wiki/core/concepts/non_linear_search.md`.

## Index

Every skill below is a **complete recipe** unless marked `(stub)` — the stubs are gathered
under "Pending — stubbed" at the end, with a queue of catalogued-but-unstubbed topics after
them.

### Meta

- [`_style.md`](./_style.md) — writing guide every skill is authored against. Read first
  before adding or editing any skill.
- [`_bootstrap_skill.md`](./_bootstrap_skill.md) — protocol for authoring a new skill on
  demand when a user requests a capability not yet covered.

### Setup & maintenance

- [`al_setup_environment.md`](./al_setup_environment.md) — detect absent or broken PyAuto\*
  environments, install via pip or editable clones when needed, configure caches, verify imports.
- [`al_update_wiki.md`](./al_update_wiki.md) — refresh `wiki/core/` pages whose pinned
  source commits have moved; surface new public APIs for review.
- [`al_audit_skill_apis.md`](./al_audit_skill_apis.md) — verify every PyAuto\* symbol
  cited in `skills/` and `wiki/core/api+stack/` resolves in the installed stack;
  report stale references with suggested replacements.
- [`al_refresh_api_docs.md`](./al_refresh_api_docs.md) — orchestrate a full maintenance
  sweep across skill recipes, wiki API pages, and pinned-source drift after a PyAuto\*
  upgrade or source refresh.
- [`al_ingest_paper.md`](./al_ingest_paper.md) — add a strong-lensing paper (local PDF
  or arxiv URL) to `wiki/literature/`: per-paper stub, concept cross-links, log entry.

### Project workflow

- [`start-new-project.md`](./start-new-project.md) — the single bridge to a standalone
  **science project** and its full lifecycle (Create → Work → Collaborate → Publish):
  scaffold a lean repo that copies the reproducible science and refers back to the assistant
  for skills/wiki, run modelling with reproducibility manifests + the `wiki/project/` journal,
  build collaborator summaries, and harden for an open-science release (CITATION/license/Zenodo).
  Optional HPC folder.
- [`contribute-upstream.md`](./contribute-upstream.md) — prepare a scoped change,
  push it either to your collaborator branch on `PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant`
  or to your fork, and open a draft PR into `PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant`.
- [`init-slam.md`](./init-slam.md) — populate an empty `scripts/` folder with SLaM
  pipeline script(s) copied from `autolens_workspace` and tailored to the chosen data
  type.

### Data preparation

- [`al_prepare_imaging_data.md`](./al_prepare_imaging_data.md) — load and preprocess
  FITS imaging, decide masking for real data, measure noise, prepare PSF.
- [`al_simulate_dataset.md`](./al_simulate_dataset.md) — synthesise a lens dataset
  (imaging or interferometer) from a ground-truth model.

### Model building

- [`al_build_imaging_model.md`](./al_build_imaging_model.md) — compose a `Tracer` from
  light + mass profiles and wrap it in an `AnalysisImaging`.
- [`al_build_interferometer_model.md`](./al_build_interferometer_model.md) — same, but
  for visibility-plane data.
- [`al_custom_profile.md`](./al_custom_profile.md) — write a new light or mass profile
  subclass and register it for use in models.

### Fitting

- [`al_configure_search.md`](./al_configure_search.md) — pick and tune a non-linear
  search (Nautilus, Dynesty, Emcee, Zeus, …) for your problem.
- [`al_run_search.md`](./al_run_search.md) — execute `search.fit(model=..., analysis=...)`
  and monitor convergence.
- [`al_chain_searches.md`](./al_chain_searches.md) — sequence searches so a later phase
  inherits priors from an earlier one.
- [`al_run_slam_pipeline.md`](./al_run_slam_pipeline.md) — run a Source-Light-Mass
  pipeline (the canonical automated lensing workflow).
- [`al_debug_fit_failure.md`](./al_debug_fit_failure.md) — diagnose a fit that didn't
  converge or produced unphysical results.

### Results & visualisation

- [`al_load_results.md`](./al_load_results.md) — load a completed fit's `Tracer`,
  `Samples`, dataset and FITS products from its output folder.
- [`al_plot_tracer.md`](./al_plot_tracer.md) — plot ray tracing, critical curves,
  caustics, magnification maps.
- [`al_plot_fit_residuals.md`](./al_plot_fit_residuals.md) — plot model image,
  residuals, normalised residuals, chi-squared map.
- [`al_inspect_source_reconstruction.md`](./al_inspect_source_reconstruction.md) —
  inspect a pixelised inversion: regularisation, source-plane image, reconstruction
  diagnostics.

### Pending — stubbed (need full recipes)
