# Maintainer mode

Active when `.maintainer` exists at the repo root (gitignored; `touch .maintainer` /
`rm .maintainer`). The session is **assistant-maintenance** — editing the constitution,
skills, wiki schema, hooks, or infrastructure — not user lensing science. `AGENTS.md`
"Session start" routes here when the sentinel is present.

## What changes

- Skip the `wiki/project/profile.md` read/create and the newcomer-mode defaults.
- Skip the session-start API drift-check by default (run it manually before testing any
  generated script).
- **No auto-commit.** The maintainer drives every commit; stage explicitly, announce, and
  never push.
- Don't offer to add `wiki/project/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` entries.
- The **source-edit boundary** is lifted: you may edit `wiki/core/`, hooks, and assistant
  infrastructure (that is the point of maintenance work).

## What does NOT change

- Every safety invariant in `AGENTS.md` still applies — in particular the two hard-absolutes
  (the real-data inspection gate and never-rewrite-history), plus bulk-edit safety and the
  `output/` write-ban.
- Commits follow the actual-harness attribution rule in `AGENTS.md`; never
  fabricate a provider identity or model.

## Maintainer procedures

Use the existing skills, not new docs:

- Authoring or evolving a skill → [`skills/_bootstrap_skill.md`](../skills/_bootstrap_skill.md).
- Regenerating `wiki/core/` against pinned sources → `al_update_wiki`.
- API gate / version baseline → [`skills/al_audit_skill_apis.md`](../skills/al_audit_skill_apis.md).

## Release-time wiki-currency check (two triggers, one check)

The currency rules — symbol audit, idiom deny-list, provenance — live in **exactly one
place**: [`.github/workflows/wiki-currency.yml`](../.github/workflows/wiki-currency.yml) in
this repo, driving `autoassistant/audit_skill_apis.py`. The check versions with the content
it grades, so it must not be reimplemented anywhere else. Two triggers feed that one check:

- **Release (workflow_call).** PyAutoHands's `release.yml` — the same run that regenerates
  the workspace/howtolens notebooks and the API baseline — invokes `wiki-currency.yml` via
  `uses:`, passing the new `stack_version` and `assistant_ref: main`. It installs that exact
  stack and runs all four checks. On drift the reusable workflow fails; PyAutoHands's
  dependent `if: failure()` job downloads the `wiki-drift-report` artifact and opens a "wiki
  drift" issue against this repo. **PyAutoHands only orchestrates and reports — it holds no
  copy of the rules.** (If releases ever move off PyAutoHands, the `repository_dispatch`/
  `workflow_call` trigger moves to whatever cuts the release; this workflow is unchanged.)
- **Assistant change (pull_request / schedule).** The same workflow runs on every PR and
  weekly against the *currently-released* stack, catching drift a wiki/skill edit introduces
  before it merges.

Ordering matters at release: PyAutoHands regenerates + commits the API baseline **before**
calling this workflow, so `--check-version` compares the new stack against an already-updated
baseline. When you change the rules, edit them here only; never copy a rule into PyAutoHands.

## Assistant-as-template: generic vs PyAutoLens-specific

This repo is the reference implementation future PyAuto domain assistants (e.g.
`autofit_assistant`, `autogalaxy_assistant`) will be modelled on. When maintaining it, keep
this boundary in mind — it is the seam a future cloning workflow will cut along. Do not
generalise anything pre-emptively; just avoid entangling the two sides.

**Generic assistant infrastructure** (clones to any domain assistant near-verbatim):
`AGENTS.md`'s skeleton (session start, safety invariants, three-layer model, mode
selection, source-of-truth resolution, commit cadence), the root `AI_POLICY.md` usage
policy, the Teacher/Assistant mode model and `modes/` machinery (the `.maintainer`
sentinel), the skills framework
(`_style.md`, `_bootstrap_skill.md`, the README index conventions), the
`core`/`literature`/`project` wiki split and its read-only/update rules, the science-project
lifecycle (`start-new-project`, `contribute-upstream`), `sources.yaml` + the source
registry pattern, the API gate (`autoassistant/audit_skill_apis.py` + wiki-currency
workflow), the profile template, the benchmark machinery (the
`benchmarks/AGENTS.md` contract + the `autoassistant/benchmark.py` harness, with
`benchmarks/harnesses.yaml` — the headless command templates per agent runtime —
and `benchmarks/VERSIONS.lock`, whose *shape* is generic while its entries are
regenerated per reference), and
`.mcp.json` (it wires the results-inspector MCP, which *is* `autoassistant.mcp` —
generic tooling, so the wiring carries no domain either), and the harness adapters
(`.claude/`, `.codex/hooks.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`) that load the canonical
instructions or register the shared assistant safety gates. Claude command links
for generic skills share their canonical skill classification; command links for
`al_*`, `euclid_*` and `init-slam` are domain content.

**PyAutoLens-specific content** (regenerated per domain, never copied blind): every
`al_*` skill body, `wiki/core/` reference pages, the entire `wiki/literature/` sub-wiki,
bundled `dataset/` examples, the README's science framing and three example prompts, the
standard-imports convention, `hpc/` templates tuned to lensing runtimes, the
benchmark prompt cards (`benchmarks/prompts/` — the cards *and* each one-shot
card's own `score.py`, since what an answer is worth is domain knowledge; a new
domain writes its own cards against its own bundled data) and the hidden
reference values behind them (`benchmarks/truth/`), the
**euclid mode** (`skills/euclid_*.md` + the `wiki/euclid/` sub-wiki — a
survey-specific pipeline register that is lensing science throughout; a newborn
grows whatever survey modes its own domain has, if any), `paper/` (this
assistant's own JOSS paper — a newborn writes its own), the README figure
assets in `docs/` (COSMOS-Web Ring imagery + the `make_readme_figures.py`
script that renders it — a newborn regrows its own), and the bundled science
scripts in `scripts/` (`*_cosmos_web_ring.py`, tied to a named lens; only
`scripts/`'s own AGENTS/CLAUDE/README docs are generic), and the setup and
evaluation pages under `docs/` (the agent-access mechanics read the same everywhere; the
worked prompts and dataset names are domain).

**Mixed** (structure generic, values domain-specific): `llms.txt` read-order,
`config/`, `benchmarks/README.md` (protocol generic, benchmark table domain), the
maintainer smoke tests below.

Generated `.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md` wrappers are **domain** for cloning: their
namespace and targets belong to this assistant, so they must never be copied
blind. Regenerate them from the newborn's adapted skill inventory with Brain's
project-discovery installer. (`docs/archive/` is retired chat-era material and is not
cloned at all.)

**Per-clone data** (never copied to a newborn — each clone accumulates its own):
`benchmarks/runs/` and the regenerated `benchmarks/RESULTS.md`. A newborn starts with
empty runs and regenerates `RESULTS.md` via `python autoassistant/benchmark.py report`.

## Harness compatibility smoke test

The assistant is supported only inside a coding agent, and the support statements in the README
are deliberately narrow: **Claude Code and Codex recommended; OpenCode experimental; Gemini CLI a
candidate for evaluation; browser chats unsupported** (retired 2026-09-10 — the old routes and
their smoke checks are archived under `docs/archive/`). Do not widen any of that from an
impression; run the checks and record them.

The protocol is [`docs/evaluation/agent_evaluation.md`](../docs/evaluation/agent_evaluation.md)
and the frozen card is `benchmarks/prompts/harness_smoke.md`: grounded answering, a small fit
whose figure the agent must actually look at, and recovery from a planted stale-API error.
Scaffold, score and report it exactly like a science benchmark
(`python autoassistant/benchmark.py new-run harness-smoke --model <m> --harness <h>`).
Before spending an operator's half hour on it, run the cheap headless check —
`python autoassistant/benchmark.py run oneshot-smoke --model <m> --harness <h>` — which drives
the harness one-shot with no operator and computes its own score: it is the first thing to run
on a newborn clone or a new agent runtime, and a zero there (a question asked, no `result.json`,
a blown budget) disqualifies the configuration before the rubric card is worth starting.

Run it after documentation changes are on the public repository, and:

- **On each recommended agent** (Claude Code, Codex) whenever `AGENTS.md`'s session-start or
  safety sections change — confirm the drift check runs, the real-data gate fires on the bundled
  dataset, and the plotting regression (`aplt.subplot_fit_imaging(...)`, never
  `aplt.FitImagingPlotter` / `aplt.MatPlot2D`) holds.
- **On OpenCode with a named provider/model** before any configuration is written into
  `docs/setup/opencode_cli.md` as tested. Record provider, model, date and whether the model
  could see the fit figure; a configuration without image input fails check 2 by construction.
- **On Gemini CLI** only as evaluation — `.gemini/settings.json` stays so it loads `AGENTS.md`,
  but no user-facing setup page is added until a run is recorded. Verify the current access
  terms first (the setup page retired on 2026-06-18 said free/individual access had ended; the
  CLI's quota document currently lists a free individual tier — resolve before recording).

Record the harness, date, plan/account context, files the agent actually read, and any
limitations. Plan availability changes, so results describe observed behaviour rather than
promise that a feature is free (or paid) for every user.
