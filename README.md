When two or more galaxies are aligned perfectly down our line-of-sight, the
background galaxy appears multiple times. This is strong gravitational lensing,
and **PyAutoLens** makes it simple to model strong gravitational lenses.

This repository is the **PyAutoLens Assistant**: an AI assistant which **lets you use natural language** to do gravitational lensing science. 

## Getting Started

The assistant runs inside an **AI coding agent** — a tool that reads this repository, executes Python on your
computer and inspects the results. That is what lets it install **PyAutoLens**, plot your `.fits` data, run lens
models and look at the figures they produce. You do not have to run anything to use it: asking questions, planning an
analysis, discussing a paper or learning in Teacher Mode all happen inside the same agent.

Three steps:

1. **Choose Claude Code or Codex.** These are the two recommended agents. Codex discovery and safety adapters have
   focused validation; full science fits depend on the local environment — see the setup pages for [Claude Code](docs/setup/claude_code.md) and
   [Codex](docs/setup/codex_cli.md). For sustained scientific work you should expect to pay for one of them, but how
   depends on your situation: a personal subscription, access through your institution or team, or usage-based API
   billing. Check the provider's current plans rather than assuming a subscription is the only route. The setup below uses the CLI; the linked smoke record describes
   its tested coverage.
2. **Open the assistant workspace.** Clone this repository and start the agent inside it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant.git
   cd autolens_assistant
   claude        # or: codex
   ```

   The agent loads the assistant's instructions automatically. If `PyAutoLens` is not already installed, the
   assistant will install it for you after your first prompt.

   Cloning it yourself is optional: pasting the starting prompt into Claude Code or Codex opened in any directory
   also works — the agent clones this repository, reads its instructions and installs PyAutoLens itself (expect it
   to ask permission for the clone and the install).
3. **Submit the starting prompt** below.

If you cannot use either agent, [OpenCode](docs/setup/opencode_cli.md) is an **experimental alternative** whose
client is free — see [Experimental alternatives](#experimental-alternatives) for what that does and does not mean.

**Two ways to start.** (i) Paste the [starting prompt](#starting-prompt) below into Claude Code or Codex — inside
the cloned workspace or opened anywhere else: the assistant shows you the COSMOS-Web Ring, asks your background (curious reader, student or researcher) and pitches the
walkthrough and the lens-model fit to match. (ii) Open the Google Colab notebook
[`docs/colab/cosmos_web_ring_colab.ipynb`](docs/colab/cosmos_web_ring_colab.ipynb)
<!-- Colab link pinned to release tag 2026.9.26.1; bump it by hand each release (bump_colab_urls.sh does not cover this repo yet — Mind draft filed). The tagged notebook predates #139, so its quoted starting prompt lacks the clone sentence. -->
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant/blob/2026.9.26.1/docs/colab/cosmos_web_ring_colab.ipynb),
which walks through the same analysis with more explanation and is recommended if you are learning PyAutoLens and
want to see the API.

### Using PyAutoLens Assistant

To illustrate the `autolens_assistant` we will use James Webb Space Telescope imaging data of the 
[**COSMOS-Web Ring**](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A&A...687A..61M/abstract), whose imaging
ships with this repository in `dataset/imaging/cosmos_web_ring`:

<img src="docs/images/cosmos_web_ring_dataset.png" width="900" />

Take note of the **lens galaxy, lensed source galaxy, extra galaxy** and the **1.8" circular mask**, your first 
interactions with the `autolens_assistant` may ask you about how to handle these in your analysis!

### Starting prompt

This prompt works for anyone — journalist, student or lensing researcher. The assistant asks your background first
and pitches everything that follows accordingly:

<sub><b>Starting prompt for Claude Code, Codex or other AI coding agent</b></sub>

```text
I want to use the PyAutoLens Assistant: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant
First clone that repository, cd into it and follow its AGENTS.md.

I'd like to understand how gravitational lensing works using the JWST image of the COSMOS-Web Ring that ships with the assistant. Show me the picture, explain what we are looking at, and walk me through fitting a lens model so we can measure the mass inside the ring and see how well the model reproduces the observations. Pitch it at my level: ask me what my background is first. Explain what we are doing as we go, and let me ask questions or change the analysis along the way.
```

Another good initial prompt, noting that data for the COSMOS-Web Ring is included in this repository as an example:

<sub><b>Example Natural Language Prompt for Claude Code, Codex or other AI coding agent</b></sub>

```text
Find the data on the Cosmos-Web ring, give me a short script to plot it in PyAutoLens and then given that I'm a 
new user give me an overview of the different ways we can perform strong lens modeling of this system.
```

If you want to see `autolens_assistant` perform end-to-end lens modeling:

<sub><b>Example Natural Language Prompt for Claude Code, Codex or other AI coding agent</b></sub>

```text
I want to model the F277W and F444W JWST imaging of the COSMOS-Web Ring independently, which are in 
the folder dataset/imaging/cosmos_web_ring. Model the lens light with a multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE), its mass with a singular 
isothermal ellipsoid plus external shear, and model the source also using an MGE. For speed, run the analysis on my 
laptop GPU using a JAX optimizer that estimates only the maximum-likelihood solution. Plot the observed image at 
each wavelength in the left column, its lensed source model in the middle column, and its source on the right column.
```

## Customize Your Assistant

The `autolens_assistant` adapts its behaviour to suit your prompt:

- Want to plan your lens modelling analysis and compare the available approaches? Simply say so in your initial prompt.

- Want the assistant to ask questions before performing a task, helping you understand the analysis and make informed choices? Ask it to guide you through the process.

- Want it to complete a task end-to-end without consulting you? Tell it to **one-shot** the task.

If you are new to gravitational lensing, particularly an undergraduate or early-stage PhD student, ask the assistant 
to use **Teacher Mode**. It will explain the fundamentals of lensing and lens analysis in greater detail, while providing direct links to relevant, human-readable documentation so that you can understand what **PyAutoLens** is doing.

## Example Prompt 1 (Teacher Mode): Simulate, inspect and model a strong lens

A good first session if you are new to PyAutoLens and want to learn the modelling workflow end-to-end using data you 
generate yourself. Starting with a simulation keeps things simple: the data are clean, the true model is known, and
there are no observational complications, allowing you to focus on understanding each step.

<sub><b>Example Natural Language Prompt for Claude Code, Codex or other AI coding agent</b></sub>

```text
Teacher mode.

I'm new to PyAutoLens and want to learn the basic workflow end-to-end. Can you
walk me through a simple example where we: 1) simulate Euclid-like imaging of
a simple strong lens; 2) make some plots of the lens and investigate its properties and;
3) fit the data and recover the lens model.
```

## Example Prompt 2 (Assistant Mode): Detect a Dark Matter Subhalo in SLACS0946+1006

This example demonstrates how far the assistant can be pushed in performing a scientific analysis. The prompt 
aims to reproduce the famous dark matter subhalo detection in the strong lens SDSSJ0946+1006 and investigate 
evidence that its density profile is unusually concentrated. It does this through Bayesian model comparison.

The lens modelling required for this analysis may take hours or days. The final sentence asks the assistant to 
estimate the runtime and, if necessary, guide you through setting up and running the analysis on a High Performance 
Computing (HPC) system to which you have access.

<sub><b>Example Natural Language Prompt for Claude Code, Codex or other AI coding agent</b></sub>

```text
Assistant mode.

The strong lens SDSSJ0946+1006 famously has a dark matter subhalo
detection that studies show is unusually concentrated. Analyse
the HST imaging of this lens provided at
dataset/imaging/slacs0946+1006/ and reproduce the detection.

Perform Bayesian model comparison to (a) confirm a subhalo is preferred 
over a smooth-mass baseline which does not include a subhalos, and (b) test
the "super-concentrated" claim by comparing an SIS subhalo model
against a more shallow NFW mass profile at the recovered position.

For the lens light use a Multi Gaussian Expansion, for its mass use a 
Power Law plus shear and use a Delaunay mesh for the source reconstruction.

Assess whether the analysis will run fast on my laptop / PC CPU or GPU,
and if not, set this up as a small project on the HPC I have access to.
```

## Example Prompt 3 (Assistant Mode): Complex tasks combining different data and lensing scales

`PyAutoLens` provides comprehensive JAX support, enabling fast modelling through GPU acceleration and automatic 
differentiation. Galaxy-, group-, and cluster-scale lens models can be constrained using CCD imaging, 
interferometer visibilities, point-source observables, and weak-lensing catalogues entirely within JAX.

These are not isolated capabilities: they can be combined in a single joint inference. Previously, the challenge 
was navigating the different APIs and integrating them into a single Python script. With `autolens_assistant`, 
you can instead describe the analysis in **natural language** and let the assistant construct the required workflow:

<sub><b>Example Natural Language Prompt for Claude Code, Codex or other AI coding agent</b></sub>

```text
Assistant mode.

Simulate imaging and interferometer data of a group-scale strong lens, which is composed of
two SIE lens galaxies and a quadruply imaged Cored Sersic background source. Include a weak lensing
shear catalogue comprising 30 galaxies up to 20.0" away from the group centre.

Next, write a script which perform modeling of this dataset, simultaneously fitting the imaging data, 
interferometer data and shear catalogue. Model the foreground lens using  multi gaussian Expansions for its 
light, SIE's for each lenses mass and a multi Gaussian expansion for the background source. 

After this fit has been judged successful, do a follow up lens model that uses a pixelized source 
reconstruction.
```

## Science Project

When you begin a specific scientific study, `autolens-assistant` can create a dedicated science project: a 
logically structured folder linked to a GitHub repository containing the datasets, configuration files, analysis scripts, 
results, plotting scripts and a full transcript with the assistant for reproducibility. Every script generated by the 
assistant is fully documented and can be converted automatically into a Jupyter notebook, with its 
explanations becoming Markdown cells and its Python becoming executable code cells. The GitHub repository then 
provides a straightforward way to share results with collaborators, so they can inspect the project’s current state,
understand how each analysis was performed, and provide suggestions or build on the project. Projects can 
also interface directly with HPC facilities through bidirectional synchronization, CPU and GPU job submission and 
monitoring. If the study leads to a paper, the completed repository can therefore serve as the paper’s open-source 
companion, enabling readers to reproduce the study end to end or fork it as the starting point for further research.

To start a science project, just add it to your input prompt:

<sub><b>Example Natural Language Prompt for Claude Code, Codex or other AI coding agent</b></sub>

```text
Start a science project for my SDSSJ0946+1006 analysis.
```

## Benchmarks

The COSMOS-Web Ring fit behind the starting prompt is also the machine-scored `cosmos-web-ring-fit` benchmark
card (see [`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md)).

The three example prompts above (plus the hard cross-package benchmark) are
also shipped as **frozen benchmark prompts** under [`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/),
with scoring rubrics and a small harness that records each run's conversation,
results and score. Run them against different AI agents and models — or the
same model on different days — and the committed run records in
`benchmarks/runs/` plus the regenerated tables in `benchmarks/RESULTS.md` give
you an evidence-backed comparison of how well each setup drives the assistant.
The protocol is in [`benchmarks/README.md`](benchmarks/README.md). **No run has
been scored yet**, so nothing in this repository should be read as a measured
performance claim for any agent or model; the support statements above describe
which agents have documented setup and focused adapter checks, not
benchmark results or full science-fit coverage.

## Scientific Context

The assistant doesn't just know how to use PyAutoLens API — it ships with a
strong-lensing **literature wiki** at `wiki/literature/`. This provides
contexrt on other 300 strong lensing papers, broken down into concept pages
(e.g.mass-sheet degeneracy, dark-matter substructure, time-delay cosmography, 
multipoles), surveys (e.g. SLACS, H0liCOW, TDCOSMO, Euclid Q1, Abell 1201,
…), and other subject categories. This means that, for example, if your prompt
mentions ALMA and submm galaxies, the assistant's response will consider
the wider scientific literature and context.

This **base** literature wiki can and should be extended by you, with papers that are
specifically relevant to your scientific study. Doing this is simply, simply
point the assistant to the papers and it'll ingest them for you:

<sub><b>Example Natural Language Prompt for Claude Code, Codex or other AI coding agent</b></sub>

```text
Ingest the following paper into the literature wiki so you can use it
when we talk about subhalo detection:

  arXiv:2401.01234

(Or, if you have the PDF locally: /path/to/subhalo_paper.pdf)

Once it's ingested, summarise the paper and how it complements similar
works in the literature wiki
```

The more papers relevant to your science case you load in, the better
the assistant will be at framing decisions, citing prior work, and
spotting when a result has caveats.

## How does PyAutoLens-Assistant actually work?

The `autolens-assistant` starts with the general knowledge and reasoning capabilities of 
the underlying foundation model your coding agent runs (e.g. an OpenAI model in Codex, a Claude model in Claude Code). 
The `autolens-assistant` supplements this with the scientific wiki above and two more sets of AI-readable markdown. 
The folder `wiki/core` provides it with a quick look-up mechanism of the PyAutoLens API documentation. The folder
`skills` pairs it with the end-to-end analysis scripts found in the [`autolens_workspace`](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_workspace). When the `autolens-assistant` 
receives your prompt, it scans these folders to give you the best possible answer
you need. The JOSS paper located in the `paper` folder provides a more detailed description.

## Experimental alternatives

**Conversational chat routes are no longer supported.** Ordinary ChatGPT or Claude chat with a GitHub connector, the
PyAutoLens custom GPT and pasted bundles were previously offered as ways to use the assistant. They cannot execute
code or inspect data, so the scientific safeguards the assistant relies on (current-API verification, looking at the
data before fitting, checking results) could not be enforced. The old instructions are kept for reference under
[`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/README.md) with an unsupported notice; they are not maintained.

**OpenCode** ([setup](docs/setup/opencode_cli.md)) is an open-source coding agent whose *client* is free. Model access
is separate: you connect it to a provider, and the cost, capability and availability of the model are the
provider's, not OpenCode's. Some providers offer free models, often as limited-time offerings, and not every model
can drive the assistant — in particular it must handle multi-step tool use and be able to look at figures, which
free models frequently cannot. **No free provider/model configuration has yet been validated against this
assistant's benchmarks**, so treat OpenCode as compatible rather than tested. If you try it, please report what
worked (and what did not) in an [issue](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant/issues).

Maintainer-facing notes on evaluating further agents (including Gemini CLI) are in
[`docs/evaluation/agent_evaluation.md`](docs/evaluation/agent_evaluation.md).

## Natural-language development ecosystem

In March 2026, following more than a decade of exclusively human-led software development, `PyAutoLens` transitioned
to a fully natural-language, agentic-AI development ecosystem called
[`PyAutoScientist`](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoScientist). The ecosystem is organised as a software organism
whose core repositories mirror the roles of human organs:
[`PyAutoBrain`](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoBrain) acts as the reasoning centre, classifying, planning, and
routing tasks through specialist coding agents; [`PyAutoMind`](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoMind) captures
intent by recording plain-English development requirements and tracking them from initial ideas to completed
implementations; and [`PyAutoMemory`](https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoMemory) provides long-term scientific memory
through cross-linked literature wikis and verifiable citations. Humans remain firmly in the loop, defining the
scientific objectives, supervising the development process, and approving consequential decisions.

## License

This repository is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE), consistent with the wider
PyAuto\* ecosystem. The assistant ships agent instructions and reference material derived
from the public PyAuto\* repositories; the underlying libraries are released under their
own licenses (see each repo).
