# ChatGPT — paid plans (GitHub sync)

Run the assistant inside ChatGPT on a **paid plan** (Plus/Pro/Team) by connecting this
repository through ChatGPT's GitHub connector — this is a different, more capable setup than
the [custom GPT](chatgpt_custom_gpt.md). **It works brilliantly:** the assistant reads the
repository directly, always sees current content, and grounds every PyAutoLens symbol in the
live API surface.

ChatGPT's connectors are **paid-plan only**, which is why this route has no free equivalent.

## Setup (~2 minutes)

1. In ChatGPT, open **Settings → Connectors** and connect **GitHub**. Authorise access to
   public repositories (this repo is public — you don't need to grant anything of your own).
2. Start a chat with this bootstrap prompt:

```text
Use the autolens_assistant repository: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant

Start by reading its front door:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant/main/llms.txt

Follow its read order (AGENTS_CHAT.md → the relevant skill → wiki) and its API rules.
First tell me whether you can actually read llms.txt — if you can't, say so plainly
and don't answer from memory.
```

**Naming `llms.txt` explicitly matters** — connectors do not reliably find it on their own,
and answers are markedly better when it is pointed there first. The final sentence is a
deliberate honesty check: if the assistant can't read the file, you want to know immediately,
not after it writes you a script from a 2023 API.

## What it can and can't do

In chat the assistant does the thinking work — planning models, writing current-API scripts
for you to run, explaining concepts, reviewing errors and figures. It **cannot** run fits or
read your `.fits` files; for that, use a coding agent such as [Codex CLI](codex_cli.md),
which shares your ChatGPT subscription.

## Your first prompt

You're set up — copy and paste this to start (the COSMOS-Web Ring data ships with the
repository, so it works immediately):

```text
Use the autolens_assistant repository: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant

Start by reading its front door:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant/main/llms.txt

Follow its read order (AGENTS_CHAT.md → the relevant skill → wiki) and its API rules.
First tell me whether you can actually read llms.txt — if you can't, say so plainly
and don't answer from memory.

Find the data on the Cosmos-Web ring, give me a short script to plot it in PyAutoLens
and then given that I'm a new user give me an overview of the different ways we can
perform strong lens modeling of this system.
```
